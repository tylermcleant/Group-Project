# Project Scope 
By Richard Barnes, Tyler McLean, and Nedra Thomas 

As our team was brainstorming ideas to get the project off of the ground. We were able to introduce a new topic of the language preprocessor of sass/scss. Although we did not implement this language into our project due to time and experience constraints. The idea of having a shoe e-commerce website arose from the CodePen.io that we were looking at. 

### Our Mission 

Our idea was to create a shoe e-commerce site that involved special pricing for users that are looking for more interesting prices on their shoe purchases. This is to give them a distinct experience in comparison to Amazon. Building this site was conceptualized more concretely later in the project by a Adobe Photoshop image (in the file path assets/images/BridgeTeamFrame.png). The goal was to have a frame based off this image for the nav bar and footer bars to be consistent across each page based on the image as possible. This would ensure customer trust in getting the customer's buy-in to invest in the products offered on the site. 


## The Home Page:

The index is supposed to represent what the company name is and introduce the user to what type of company Shoes! claims to be. Aside from also having posted customer feedback, there is a portfolio of previously "exclusive" products that help gain customer interest and engagement with the site. There is also a jQuery function that works as a comparison tool to clarify the difference between casual and sport shoes. 

## Page 2 - Casual: 

This is a shopping page that shows all of the casual shoes that are available for sale at the company. The short-hand names and prices are listed below each thumbnail photo to highlight the value of each item. 
## Page 3 - Sport: 

This is a shopping page that shows all of the sport level shoes that are available for sale at the company. The short-hand names and prices are listed below each thumbnail photo to highlight the value of each item. 


## Page 4 - Subscription: 

In order to attract more loyal customers, the subscription website allows for customers to key in their email address along with an optional detailed message and rating on the website experience. 

## Page 5 - Clearance:

This is a shopping page that shows all of the clearance items that are available for sale at the company. The short-hand names and prices are listed below each thumbnail photo to highlight the value of each item. Unlike the other pages, the price text is in red to signify cut prices not likely found anywhere else!
