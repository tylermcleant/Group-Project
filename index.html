    <p class="container-sm test"><em><q>I was shopping for a new pair of sneakers for a trip back home to visit family and attend a wedding while I was there. I was looking for something fresh and clean for SoCal. I went to Shoes! because I knew them from previous buys to have nice stuff, very affordable, and it ships nicely. I have only had one mix up in ordering through them in the past and they refunded my purchase that they messed up, I never got the shoes because they said they no longer had the stock, but anyway, <strong>I still like and trust the site to have something I'm looking for at a good price.</strong></q></em><br>
    <br><em><q>This was a <strong>painless experience</strong>, couldn’t have been better. The website was self-explanatory. So easy to use and navigate, within minutes I had exactly what I was looking for in my cart and I was checking out. Can’t wait for my order to arrive, highly recommend Shoes!.</q></em>
  <br><br><br><em><q>Shoes! is a very good company that I plan to continue to shop with in the near future. They have <strong>a wide variety of shoes to choose from</strong> that will fit the desired style you're looking for and they also have amazing discount offers as well. Overall, shopping with them will leave you happy and satisfied.</q></em>
<br><br><em><q>My sneakers were bought for my children and they <strong>came in a timely manner.</strong> The sneakers fit perfectly. The color of the sneakers were correctly shown. I am satisfied with my purchase.</q></em></p>
